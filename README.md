A [Wavefront OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) parser and
utility crate.

```toml
[dependencies]
wavefront = "x.y.z"
```

## Example

```rust
let model = wavefront::Obj::from_file("tests/ship.obj").unwrap();

for [a, b, c] in model.triangles() {
    // No index lookup required: wavefront handles this for you!
    println!("{:?} {:?} {:?}", a.position(), b.position(), c.position());
}
```

# Features

- Ergonomic API for parsing OBJs from files and readers.

- Wrapper types that automatically perform indexing and hide the annoyances of
  the OBJ format if you just want to grab some triangles...

- ...but allows you to dip into the nitty-gritty details of OBJ if you want to
  do that too.

- Correct handling of N-polygons.

- Handling of vertex colors.

- No dependencies

## Roadmap

- Materials and the MTL support.

- Object, group, polygon, vertex and vertex attribute insertion

- Saving

- Arbitrary geometry support.

## Why not [alternative]?

`wavefront` was born of a general feeling that the API of existing OBJ parsers
were either unnecessarily verbose or didn't properly handle the heirarchical
structure of the OBJ format. `wavefront` aims to couple correct handling of the
format's features with a clean, terse API that allows you to jump straight to
the thing you want to do: rendering your model.
